# 1D-Cellular-Automaton

The purpose of this short project was to create a one dimensional cellular automaton, where user can define parameters:

* r - neighbourhood size
* starting conditions - either set seed or random
* starting rule with accordance to wolfram rules
* other parameters like cell size, number of iterations etc.

Visualisation of the Cellular automaton process is visualised in the last cell of the notebook file. 
For example, CA using set seed and rule 18 (00010010) looks like that:
